## 1. Reddit (r/ObsidianMD) – Soft Launch

**Title:** Obsidian Nextcloud Media – Sync your media files with Nextcloud (Swiss-made, privacy-first)

---

Hey everyone,

I've been working on a plugin that solves a problem I've had for years: **syncing media files between Obsidian and Nextcloud** without relying on cloud services or giving up control over my data.

### What it does:
- **Media sync** between Obsidian vaults and Nextcloud (WebDAV)
- **Offline-first** – works without internet, syncs when connected
- **Privacy-focused** – no tracking, no analytics, your data stays yours
- **4K video streaming** and instant image previews (Pro)

### Free vs Pro:
The core sync is **completely free**. Pro ($29 lifetime) adds power-user features like unlimited cache, background sync, and priority support.

### Why Nextcloud?
If you're already self-hosting Nextcloud or use a trusted provider, this gives you a seamless media workflow without touching Google/Dropbox/iCloud.

Built by a small Swiss company (Fentrea GmbH). No VC, no data harvesting – just a tool that works.
